The first programming languages ​​appeared in the 1940s. These languages ​​were simple, difficult to learn, and required mathematics. In the 1990s - when universities, companies, and individuals started using the Internet - computing speed and computer memory improved, making it more difficult to use programming languages. These languages ​​are now available in open source platforms and online tutorials. People learn programming languages ​​and programming languages ​​are developing Today, children can easily learn a programming language such as JavaScript.Programming in our lives is very important nowadays we depend on it for everything. The daily activities of the human being have become dependent on applications and software that are irreplaceable, for programming is codes and algorithms<br>
During the past decades, there has been a great development in software and programming languages, and this has led to an evolution in the interface of software design and languages ​​written in it, because it has become more accessible and interactive than more fun to learn and programming
